Employee Retention: The Auditing department has a higher termination rate than other departments. This suggests a need to investigate the underlying reasons for this high turnover and implement measures to improve employee retention in this department.

Auditing: The high termination rate in Auditing may be due to factors like high stress levels, lack of career growth opportunities, or inadequate training.
Engineering: The significant male dominance in Engineering may require targeted efforts to attract and retain female talent in this field.
